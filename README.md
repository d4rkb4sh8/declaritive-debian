Pros:

    Comprehensive System Capture: All installed software, regardless of installation method, is tracked and added to the configuration file.
    Reproducibility: Every package, including flatpaks and snaps, can be installed on another machine to replicate the system environment.
    Cross-Package Format Management: Supports different types of packaging systems used on Debian, making the solution more flexible.

Cons:

    Flatpak/Snap Installation: Replicating packages across systems may require flatpak or snap to be installed manually before applying the configuration.
    Snap/Flatpak Versions: Managing version locking for these formats is not as straightforward as for apt and .deb packages.

    Backup & Rollback:
        The script creates a snapshot of the system before applying changes, storing it in a time-stamped directory defined by backup_dir.
        The rollback_system_state function allows rolling back to any saved state by passing the backup directory as an argument.

    Example:


How to Use:

    Apply Configuration: Move config to $HOME folder Run the script to apply system configuration:

    bash

sudo bash apply-declarative-system.sh

Key Additions:

    Backup Directory Creation:
        The script creates the backup directory at $HOME/backup if it does not exist.

    First-Time Configuration File Creation:
        The script checks for the existence of system-declaration.cfg. If it doesn't exist, it creates the file and populates it with empty lists for each type of package.

    Config Modification for Future Runs:
        If system-declaration.cfg exists, the script loads it and dynamically updates it based on current installed packages.

    Backups:
        Each time the script is run, it creates a timestamped backup of the system-declaration.cfg file in the $HOME/backup directory.
